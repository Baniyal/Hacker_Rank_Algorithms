
def getMoneySpent(keyboards, drives, s):
        return max([sum([x,y]) for x in keyboards for y in drives if sum([x,y]) <= s]+[-1])

#two for loops in list comprehension
sum[x,y] the output of the list is an array of all the possible sum of the combination
of the keyboard and the usb drive
the +[-1] is if she is unable to buy
then we calculate the maximum value from the list which is the optimal solution
