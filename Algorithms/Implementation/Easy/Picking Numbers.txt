ets are unordered, as you say. Even though one way to implement sets is using a tree, they can also be implemented using a hash table (meaning getting the keys in sorted order may not be that trivial).

If you'd like to sort them, you can simply perform:

sorted(set(y))
which will produce a sorted list containing the set's elements. (Not a set. Again, sets are unordered.)

Otherwise, the only thing guaranteed by set is that it makes the elements unique (nothing will be there more than once).
