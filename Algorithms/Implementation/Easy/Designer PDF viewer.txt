Question : In this challenge, you will be given a list of letter heights in the alphabet and a string.
 Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in  assuming all letters are  wide.

#first using list comprehension make a list of size of all the characters 
size = [int(i) for i in input().split()] 


#then make the size of the largest word input that we got logic used
#ord function returns the ASCII value of the current character of the word
#if we subtract it from The ASCII value of the "a" we will get the size of that character as
#we pass  this value as index in size array
#now we get an array named word containing size of the various characters
word = [size[ord(c)-ord('a')] for c in input()]

print(max(word)*len(word))
